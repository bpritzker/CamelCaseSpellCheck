# These are words that we do NOT want to check for.
# A lot of them are substring from the Wikipedia List of Common Misspellings, we don't want to remove them from
#    the misspellings file because then, every time we wanted to update the file we would need to remember to
#    delete them. Instead it's better to have an exclude file so the substrings are just not checked for.
# It also give us more control to remove custom words if we find they are causing problems.
